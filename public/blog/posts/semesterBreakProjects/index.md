# Semester Break? Well, It’s When the Summer Strikes!

Long break from school. Final exams? Survived. Grades? Decent enough to get promoted to the next grade—so I’ll take that as a win.

Most people took the break to refresh. Beach days, road trips, hangouts, fun stuff.  
Me? I stared at my sticker-covered laptop, cracked my knuckles, and whispered the magic spell:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest specialProject
```

Okay maybe not *magic*, and definitely not *special*—but over the semester break, I ended up building a handful of cool projects. Some born out of boredom, others from competitions, a couple for real clients, and a few just to push my skills forward.

Let me take you through what I’ve been working on.

## 🧩 JaMak — Jaringan Masyarakat (Society Network)

A team project I worked on for a competition with **SaviorS**. The idea? A community image board where people in local neighborhoods can post and archive their event documentation and stories.

Think of it like a blend between Reddit threads and image boards like 4chan—but community-focused, constructive, and grounded in real-world events.

I built it using my favorite tech stack:
- **Next.js** (of course)
- **API Routes**
- **MongoDB**
- **ImageKit** for smooth image uploads

This project took me and Rani Anggraini (my teammate) to the **final round** of the competition! The results aren’t out yet, but fingers crossed.

## 🛠️ FWB+

One of our first serious client projects under the **Slaviors** team. We were hired by an event organizing business operating across Central Java and Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Real-world project, real-world stakes.

I was in charge of the backend—built the entire API system:
- Auth system
- Admin panel & dashboard
- User management and CRUD
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Secure endpoints and validations

The project’s still under development, but the system is solid and scalable.

## 🤖 V0ID Chatbot

Ah yes—born from boredom, shaped by creativity.

**V0ID** is a chatbot I built as a hybrid mobile app, designed with a twist: it plays the role of a comforting, motherly virtual girlfriend focused on mental health support. A little odd? Maybe. But hey—it works.

Built with:
- Tuned **Gemini AI**
- Custom prompt engineering
- Polished mobile UI and UX
- Emotional tone modeling

It’s experimental, but it’s something I’m proud of.

## 🚀 Portfolio Website Upgrades

You’re on it right now—yep, this very website. Over the break, I made a bunch of updates to keep things fresh and functional:

### New Features Added:
- ✨ Dynamic SEO & Metadata
- 📘 [Guestbook with Google oAuth](https://rejaka.me/?modal=guestbook)
- 📄 [Resume Page](https://rejaka.me/resume)
- 💬 Blog comment & like system
- 🕹️ Mini-game integration (because why not)
- 📚 Quote component
- 📊 Google Analytics tag added

This portfolio is my playground and proof-of-skill space. I treat it like a living resume—and it keeps evolving.

## 🔗 Link Site

After putting it off for way too long, I finally launched my own **link-in-bio** style website.

And yes, it also supports:
- Two dynamic themes (dark/light) like my main site
- Custom share previews
- Minimalist, responsive design

## 🔒 Projects in the Shadows (Under Development)

Right now, I'm working on two secret projects:
- One is a **revival of an old project** I once abandoned (spoiler: not staying dead anymore)
- The other is something new, exciting, and *musical* 🎧

I won’t spill the full details just yet, but trust me—they’re going to be awesome.

## Final Thoughts

While others chose to chill this summer, I chose to *build*. Not because I had to—but because I **wanted to**.

Some projects were client-focused, others were just fun experiments. But each one taught me something new and pushed me forward as a developer.

If you’re a student or aspiring dev reading this:  
Don’t underestimate what you can build in a month or two. Breaks are perfect for growth—especially when you treat them as opportunities, not just downtime.

That’s my summer.  
How’s yours going?
