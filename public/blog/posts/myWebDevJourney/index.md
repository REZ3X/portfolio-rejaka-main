# This is Me (As of Now, Of Course)

Just a *"usual"* web developer here—currently growing through competitions, events, and freelance work. Web dev wasn’t exactly my childhood dream. Actually, if you'd asked kid-me what I wanted to be, I'd probably have said *astronaut*. With lightsabers. And a spaceship. Fighting evil aliens.

Yeah, that tracks.

But life has a weird sense of humor, and somehow, here I am—writing TypeScript instead of flying rockets. So how did I get here?

Let me tell you the story.

## Not Really My Dream

When I was six, my parents gave me a book about planets. Boom. That was it—I was obsessed. I started sketching alien worlds, pretending to float through space, and turning my house into a personal spaceship.

Then Star Wars entered my life, and things got… cinematic. I started swinging imaginary lightsabers, holding fake battles in the living room, and talking to invisible droids. Pure childhood chaos.

At that point, I was 100% sure I’d grow up to be an astronaut-Jedi hybrid. But, of course, reality had other plans.

## The Dream Got Too High

Growing up in a third-world country, things hit differently. Slowly, I realized becoming an astronaut wasn’t exactly a walk in the park. It didn’t break me—I was still a kid, still full of wild dreams. One day I wanted to be a soldier, the next a ninja, the next a superhero.

But none of those felt real. They were just ideas—fueled by imagination, not passion.

Then junior high came around, and along with it… the pandemic.

## The Pandemic Fog

Covid-19 hit everyone hard. I lost connection with my friends. I lost structure. And worst of all—I lost my imagination.

For the first time in my life, I stopped caring about the future. I didn’t know what I wanted anymore, and honestly? I didn’t even feel like dreaming.

Everything just… paused.

## Found by Accident

Toward the end of junior high, when final exams were creeping closer, I randomly stumbled upon a post—probably on Facebook (memory’s fuzzy). It was about coding and mentioned an app called **Mimo** that taught programming on mobile.

I was bored, curious, and honestly just needed something—*anything*—to focus on. So I installed it.

Didn’t expect much. But turns out, that little decision changed my life.

---

## My First Code

After a few days, I was learning basic HTML and CSS. Just playing around. I even installed **Acode**, a mobile code editor, and built my very first website.

Was it pretty? No. It was a mess of boxes and default fonts.  
Was it perfect? Definitely not.  
Was I proud of it? Absolutely.

That’s when I knew—I’d found something real.

I set my eyes on a goal: get into a **vocational high school**, specifically the **SIJA major** (System Information Networking and Application), where I could dive deeper into coding and tech.

## Going Full Nerd

To get accepted, I needed top scores on my final test. So I went full-on nerd mode. I bought two thick (and pricey) study books, studied day and night, and treated every mock test like a boss battle.

And… it paid off.

**I graduated as the best student at my school.**

---

## Entering the School

I got in. I took the major I worked so hard for. And finally, I was learning things that felt real.

I revisited HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At first, it was awesome. But then came the other parts—networking, system architecture, and some stuff that didn’t excite me. To be honest? Networking just isn’t my thing.

My interest started to drop… until one day in class, I saw something that changed everything.

## “What the Hell Is That?”

One of my classmates—basically the tech genius of the room—was coding something wild. I glanced at his screen. There were files, folders, and this thing called **TypeScript**. It looked like sorcery.

He said something about “frameworks” and “components” and I was like:

> “What the hell is that?”

It looked so complex that I started doubting myself. Like—*will I ever reach that level?*  
Am I even good enough for this?

---

## Breaking… Then Exploding

Then came a turning point. There was this girl I liked (I know, here we go), and something happened. Let’s just say… I lost. It hurt. A lot.

I tried moving on, but it didn’t work. So, in that emotional mess, I did something I hadn’t done in a while—I opened my laptop. Not for distraction this time. But for purpose.

I started writing code.

---

## Finding My Flow

I jumped into JavaScript, learned **React**, then picked up **Vite**. That combo felt powerful. I built static sites, created mini projects, and kept going—even when things broke.

Eventually, I found my signature framework: **Next.js**.

Something about it just clicked. I was making full-stack apps, calling APIs, deploying sites. It wasn’t just learning anymore—it was *building*.

And I loved it.

---

## Competitions and Slaviors

Months passed. I entered coding competitions. Some wins, some Ls, but every experience leveled me up. Eventually, I created a team with my friends: **Slaviors**—a group of tech lovers like me.

We tackled real projects. Attended events. Coded late into the night.

By that point, I had my core stack locked in:

- **Next.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **MongoDB**
- **Vercel**

And honestly? I felt unstoppable.

## Looking Back (and Forward)

I didn’t plan this. I didn’t grow up wanting to be a developer. I just found it—through boredom, heartbreak, curiosity, and late nights staring at a blinking cursor.

And that’s okay.

If you're just starting your journey, don’t worry about having it all figured out. Dreams can change. Passions can form late. What matters is the spark—and what you do with it.

So if you’ve got that spark, don’t waste it.  
Build something. Break things. Try again.  
You might just end up somewhere better than you imagined.
