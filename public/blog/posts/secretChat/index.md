# 💬 GhostChat — Anonymous Secure Messaging  

Ever felt like you’re being watched online? 👀  
In today’s digital age, **privacy is no longer a luxury—it’s survival**. From data breaches to shady surveillance, sometimes you just want a space where your words vanish into thin air.  

That’s why I built…  

## 🔒 GhostChat: The Disappearing Chat Room  

**GhostChat** is a platform for people who value **privacy, security, and anonymity** above everything else.  

It’s not just another chat app. It’s:  
- **Ephemeral** → messages self-destruct after a set time  
- **Encrypted** → end-to-end security, so only you and your chat partner can read them  
- **Anonymous** → no signups, no identities, no trace  

Think of it like talking in a dark room where only you and your friend exist… and when you leave, *poof* 💨 everything is gone.

### ❓Why GhostChat?  

Because regular messaging apps just don’t cut it.  
- They track you 🕵️  
- They store your data on some server you don’t control  
- Your chats live forever (sometimes even after you delete them)  

GhostChat flips the script. **What you say disappears when you want it gone.**
