# This is Us

It's been a pretty long journey, to be honest… wait, have I ever told you about **Slaviors**? No? Well buckle up, because it’s simple—but also, *not that simple*.

## Slaviors

Slaviors is a group of six. We're basically a bunch of tech nerds—well, let’s go with *tech enthusiasts*, that sounds more marketable. We come from different backgrounds, skills, and majors, but we unite under one mission: **digitalizing the business world**.

We specialize in web development, chatbot integration, and UI/UX design. That’s the elevator pitch. But the real story? Oh, it's a long, chaotic, and fun ride. Ready to hear it?

## The Story of Us

### SMKN 2 Depok’s First Avengers

Okay, maybe not Avengers, but close.

Back in September (or was it November? Details are blurry), a web optimization competition came along. Our school sent a team of five—yours truly included. The competition stretched on forever because of some issues with the organizing company. One of our members was like a ghost: always busy, never there, but somehow still technically part of the team.

Despite all that, **we won**. First place, baby! And along with the victory came a prize and an apprenticeship. (More on that… drama incoming.)

---

### Babu Smarts (a.k.a. The Smart Slaves)

Ah yes, the apprenticeship era—where we unknowingly signed up to be overworked interns. We had multiple projects thrown at us, complete with chaos, miscommunication, and mild existential crises.

Naturally, we named our group chat **"Babu Smarts"**—because we were working like *babus* (slaves), doing whatever was asked of us. Eventually, we just... left. No dramatic goodbye, we just ghosted the company like that one flaky team member.

### Slaviors: The Name Awakens

Another competition rolled in—not a sequel to the first, more like a spin-off. This time it was a web-building challenge. All five of us actually gave full effort (yes, even the ghost came to life). We didn’t win, but we made it to the finals and officially debuted the name **Slaviors**.

The name stuck. It sounded cool, edgy, and a little bit like we were superheroes—which honestly, we felt like.

---

### The Slaviors Uprising

Ah, *money problems*—the true startup motivator.

Turns out we never received the full prize from the first competition. So four of us (yeah, we *cut the ghost*—tough love) contacted the company and demanded the rest. Surprisingly, they agreed. We did one last project for them, got paid, and used that victory as our rebirth.

From that moment on, Slaviors became a solid team. We started attending tech events together, leveling up as a real squad.

### Slaviors: New Era Action RPG

No, it’s not a game (yet), but it *sounds* cool, doesn’t it?

This era was marked by a school assignment: we had to make a video project. So we recruited two temporary members like a DLC party. We got the job done, the project ended, and our party went back to the **OG four**.

---

### Slaviors 2.0

Cue the upgrade screen: **Slaviors now has six core members**. Two new permanent recruits joined the team. With our shared passion, goal, and slightly chaotic group energy, we’ve evolved into a *more professional* and organized version of ourselves.

Now we’re aiming higher, working smarter, and still making jokes in the group chat.

## Us as Slaviors

We’re not just a team—we’re a little family (but with less arguing and more bugs to fix). Each of us brings something unique to the table. Together, we’re Slaviors: united by code, caffeine, and the occasional meme war.

We’ve been through competitions, failures, wins, ghosting, revenge quests, and dramatic exits. But every step brought us closer to becoming the team we are today.
